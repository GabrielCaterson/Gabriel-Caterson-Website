    - Click power
    - Sidekick that targets and kills an enemy
    - Shield that absorbs one hit
    - Extra click per round
    - Guider (shows direction where your click will go)
    - 


Make it so you can only pick from one of three upgrades. 
You get one upgrade per 5 levels.











This is a game where you click the screen and the ball bounces away from where you clicked. 

You have to bounce the ball to the target within the number of clicks that the game allows. 

The game gets harder every five levels. With each increase in difficulty, the number of obstacles 
and enemies increases by one.

The game starts with two enemies who chase you. 

A random number of obstacles between 2 and 7 will also spawn in.

The player and the enemies should never spawn on the obstacles, and the enemies should spawn at 
least half the screen away from the player.

The player's ball should lose velocity over time, and should hit zero after 3 seconds.

The player should lose if they are hit by an enemy.

The player wins if they hit the target before their clicks run out.

The player has twice as many clicks as there are obstacles in the level.
